          Shigeru Miyamoto is a video game designer, producer, and
          director at Nintendo, as well as one of that company's
          managing directors.  He is the creator of numerous highly
          regarded game franchies including <em>Mario</em>, <em>The
          Legend of Zelda</em>, <em>Star Fox</em>, and <em>Donkey
          Kong</em>.  To list every notable title Miyamoto has worked on
          would take far too much space.  The most important games he
          has ever been involved with have been genre-defining:
          <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (Famicom, 1985), <em>The Legend of
          Zelda</em> (Famicom Disk System, 1986), and <em>Donkey
          Kong</em> (arcade, 1981).

          Miyamoto was born in Sonobe, Japan, in 1952 and began working
          at Nintendo in 1977.  Before Miyamoto entered the company,
          Nintendo was a fairly obscure Japanese company that made
          playing cards and toys, though the company was beginning to
          enter the video game market by the time Miyamoto came around.
          <em>Donkey Kong</em>, originally intended to be based upon the
          <em>Popeye</em> franchise, was released in 1981 and became an
          immediate hit around the world.

          Over the next 40 years, Miyamoto would contribute to dozens of
          games for every home and handheld console Nintendo made.  The
          iconic design of the Super Famicom's controller is Miyamoto's
          work, as an example.  Even on franchises where Miyamoto did
          not contribute directly, he mentored others within Nintendo.
          As an example, he mentored Satoshi Tajiri, creator of the
          Pok√©mon franchise, during the early days of that franchise's
          development.
